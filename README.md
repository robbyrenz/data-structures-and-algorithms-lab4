# data-structures-and-algorithms-lab4
Just my source code for Lab 4 of the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course
----
**Edit:** in future cases, don't opt to automatically create a README.md file if you are planning to export a repo to GitHub; I found out the hard way that GitHub *doesn't* let you merge branches because apparently they are incompatible. Thus, in order to see my final code, switch to the testing branch; that is where you will find my final source code for this assignment.
